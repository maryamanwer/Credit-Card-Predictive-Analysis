# Credit-Card-Predictive-Analysis
The objective is to create an automated model for detecting critical determinants and forecasting credit card defaults based on client information and recorded transactions.
Credit card bankruptcy occurs when you have fallen far behind on your credit card payments. At the same time, regardless of their repayment abilities, most cardholders misused their credit cards for consumption and accumulated large amounts of credit and debt. This project aims to apply supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the important drivers that influence the chance of credit card default while emphasizing the mathematical features of the approaches used..
The objective is to create an automated model for detecting critical determinants and forecasting credit card defaults based on client information and recorded transactions. The supervised machine learning paradigm's general principles are later described, along with a full description of the methodologies and algorithms utilized to generate the models
